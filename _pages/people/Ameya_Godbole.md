I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California advised by Prof. Robin Jia.

I am interested in research on natural language processing (NLP) systems that can reason over text and knowledge bases (KBs). I have worked on retrieval for open-domain question answering (ODQA), knowledge base completion (KBC), and semantic parsing for knowledge base QA (KBQA). More recently, I am exploring aspects of robustness and generalization in these systems.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow with the wonderful Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab (IESL) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
