I am an incoming Ph.D. student at USC to be advised by Prof. Robin Jia. Currently, I am interning at GAIR Lab, woking with my amazing advisor, Prof. Pengfei Liu. During my intership, I have been very fortunate to receive mentoring from Prof. Graham Neubig for a period. I received my master’s degree at Fudan Univeristy, advised by Xipeng Qiu. Before joining Fudan, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021.

My primary research interests revolve around LLM alignment, with a particular focus on issues related to LLM knowledge and reasoning. Previously, I worked in the area of Information Extraction.
