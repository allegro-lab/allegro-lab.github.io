I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California (USC), advised by Prof. Robin Jia. Before that, I received my master's degree from Fudan Univeristy and obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My primary research interests revolve around LLM understanding, with a particular focus on issues related to LLM knowledge and reasoning. Previously, I worked in the area of Information Extraction.
