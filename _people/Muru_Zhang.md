Hi! I’m an incoming PhD student at the University of Southern California, where I will be advised by Professor Swabha Swayamdipta and Professor Robin Jia. I’m interested in all things related to language models, particularly in activation engineering, post-training adaptation, interpretability and efficiency.

I completed both my Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree at University of Washington and I was very fortunate to be part of Professor Noah A. Smith’s Lab.

During my undergraduate years, I also worked in Professor Dieter Fox’s lab on computer vision and robotics.

Thanks to Ofir Press, Aaron Walsman and other amazing collaborators at UW for their mentorship and career advices, I was able to gain research experience and navigate through the academia :)

Being a teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. Being 9-quarters TA at UW on algorithm, discrete math, and introductory cs theory, I’m grateful to be able to teach these materials to the excellent audience at the Allen school.
