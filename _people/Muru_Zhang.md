I'm a first-year PhD student at USC, co-advised by Prof. Robin Jia and Prof. Swabha Swayamdipta. I'm interested in all things related to language models, particularly in activation engineering, post-training, scientific undertanding of LLM, and efficiency.

I'm currently interning with Together AI, working on adapting LLM for efficiency. In Summer 2023, I interned with the CodeWhisperer team at Amazon, where I worked on efficient long-context langauge modeling.

I completed both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and I was very fortunate to be part of Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/)'s Lab.
