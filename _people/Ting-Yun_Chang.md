Hi, I'm Ting-Yun Chang 張婷雲. I am a 3rd-year PhD student at USC CS, co-advised by Jesse Thomason and Robin Jia. I am interested in (1) understanding large language models' behavior and (2) multimodal learning of language and vision.

Previously, I did my bachelor's and master's degrees in Taiwan, both in Computer Science. I was advised by Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen at National Taiwan University and Chi-Jen Lu at Academia Sinica.
