I am currently a 4-th year Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California, co-advised by Prof. Robin Jia and Prof. Jesse Thomason. My research interests mainly focus on natural language processing and neuro-symbolic methods. Previously, I worked with Prof. Fei Sha on vision-language navigation and language pretrained models.

I finished my bachelor of computer science at Simon Fraser University and Zhejiang University through a Dual Degree Program. During my undergraduate time, I worked with Prof. Greg Mori and Prof. Oliver Schulte on robotics and reinforcement learning.
