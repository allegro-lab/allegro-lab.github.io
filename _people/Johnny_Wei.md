Hi! I am a PhD candidate (since fall 2019) at the University of Southern California, where I am advised by Robin Jia. My current interest is in the legal issues of AI, and my work often takes basic concepts from inferential statistics. Previously, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. When there are slow weeks at school, you might find me lifting (myself), swimming, biking, reading, writing, or learning. For all that I do, I want to do with love.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to email me!
