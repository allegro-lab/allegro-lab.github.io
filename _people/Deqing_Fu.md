Iâ€™m a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC). My main research interests are deep learning theory, natural language processing, and interpretability of AI systems. I'm (co-)advised by Prof. Vatsal Sharan of USC Theory Group and Prof. Robin Jia of USC NLP Group, and I'm working closely with Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi. 

Before that, I did my undergraduate and master's at the University of Chicago, in Mathematics (with Honors), Computer Science (with Honors), and Statistics. 

I have a broad interest in machine learning and deep learning. My interests include, but are not limited to, deep learning theory, interpretability of large language models, and deep generative models.
