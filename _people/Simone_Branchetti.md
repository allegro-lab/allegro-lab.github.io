Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna, Italy. I am visiting the ALLeGRo Lab for 6 months as part of my PhD programme. My main research interest is LLM watermarking, with an emphasis on intellectual property protection and an interest in data attribution. My supervisor is Prof. Danilo Montesi from the University of Bologna but here at USC I am working with Prof. Robin Jia.

I got both my Bachelor's and my Master's degrees from the University of Bologna in 2020 and 2023 respectively and all with the supervision of Prof. Montesi.

Other interests of mine are cooking, cheerleading, board games, videogames and staying relatively healthy in order to enjoy the other hobbies. Feel free to reach out for any questions you might have and/or just for a chat!
