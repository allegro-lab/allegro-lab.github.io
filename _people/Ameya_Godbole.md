I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/). My research focuses on hallucination-free and faithful generation with retrieval augmentation. I have worked on [leveraging the planning capabilities of Large Language Models(LLMs) to guide retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10490). Additionally, I study the behavior of factuality detection systems and their reliability in model selection.

In the past, I have explored retrieval for open-domain question answering (ODQA), knowledge base completion (KBC), and semantic parsing for knowledge base question answering (KBQA).
