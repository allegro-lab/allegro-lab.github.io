I am an undergraduate student (Computer Science B.S.) at USC Viterbi. My research interests lie in developing more robust, structured, and factual knowledge acquisition models.

I am grateful to be advised by Professor Robin Jia at ALLeGRo Lab and Professor Muhao Chen at LUKA Lab. I have also had the pleasure to work with Professor Hao Zhou at Insititute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University.
