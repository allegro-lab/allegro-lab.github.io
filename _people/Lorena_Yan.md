I am an undergraduate student (Computer Science B.S.) at USC Viterbi. My research interests lie in developing more robust, structured, and factual knowledge acquisition models.

I am grateful to be advised by Professor Robin Jia at ALLeGRo Lab and Professor Muhao Chen at LUKA Lab. I have also had the pleasure to work with Professor Hao Zhou at Insititute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University.

P.S. I’ve played the flute for 8 years! I also like cooking in my free time. Check out my cooking journal on <a href=“https://www.instagram.com/lorenayannnnn_foodie_mix/” target=“_blank”>ins<a/> and more about me on my <a href=“https://tianyi-lorena-yan-me.web.app/” target=“_blank”>website<a/>!
